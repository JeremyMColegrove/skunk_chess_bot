# skunk_chess_bot
A combination of Javascript chess engine bots, and a C bitboard chess engine (in progress!)

### The easiest way to get started is to:
- Clone the repo
- Host the index.html on a server (easiest way is to install VSCode extension "Live Server" and hit Go Live!)
- Play chess! You can modify the engines / parameters in sketch.js initGame() method!
